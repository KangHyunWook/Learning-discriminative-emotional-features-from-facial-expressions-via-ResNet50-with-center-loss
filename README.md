<h1>Learning discriminative emotional features from facial expressions via ResNet50 with center loss</h1>

Background: Although existing deep learning models are capable of learning separable features using softmax function, they suffer from intra-class variance when they do label predictions as illustrated in the left figure below.

To improve model performance, the predictions should be both separable and discrminative. To reduce intra-class variations and preserve both intra-class compactness and inter-class variance, the distance between the center and its corresponding deep features is penalized by the center loss, which has been first introduced by Wen et al.

This code trains the ResNet50 under the joint supervision of softmax and center loss. As a result, the deep features are effectively clustered to their respective centers as shown in the right figure above.

run as follows:
```
python main.py
```
add below options:
--center for center loss
